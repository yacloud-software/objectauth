objectauth authenticates access to objects using the triple
objecttype, objectid, user

*how* it does it is (and must remain) entirely opaque to the service(s)


==== all-access ====
some services require access to all objects in a different service.
obviously, this should be used _real_ carefully.

to enable that, objectauto supports "allaccess" method:

Example:
objectauth-client -allaccess -subject_service_id 998 -calling_service_id 158 -objecttype gitrepository

in this example "998" is the artefactserver and "158" the gitserver.
This would allow the artefact server "allaccess" to objecttype "gitrepository" when calling "gitserver".

in other words: if gitserver asks objectauth wether or not artefact server has access to a repository, the objectauth server will always say "yes".
